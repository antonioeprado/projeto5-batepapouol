# About

This is a simple chat application based on the old BatePapoUOL. To run this app, you need to run an instance of its [backend](https://github.com/antonioeprado/projeto13-batepapo-uol-api).

## Getting Started

First, run the backend server.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
